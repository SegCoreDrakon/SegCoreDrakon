👋 Hi, I’m @SegCoreDrakon
👀 I’m interested in: coding, drawing, modeling, and more.
🌱 I’m currently learning: C++, C#, Python, a bit of Assembly, and how OS/Linux work.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: open-source projects—you can count on me, even though I mostly work solo.
📫 How to reach me: It's private for now.
😄 Pronouns: he/him
⚡ Fun fact: I’m learning C++ and all my other passions entirely on my own through practice and trial-and-error.
             It’s pretty hard, but sometimes funny—like when I get a "segmentation fault (core dumped)", for example.
